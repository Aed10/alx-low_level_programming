# 0x1C-makefiles

This repository contains the solutions for the 0x1C-makefiles project, which is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

The 0x1B-makefiles project focuses on the concept of Makefiles in software development. Makefiles are used to automate the build process of a project, allowing developers to define dependencies, compile source code, and perform other tasks efficiently.

In this project, we explore the fundamentals of Makefiles, including rules, targets, dependencies, variables, and more. We learn how to write Makefiles to compile programs, manage dependencies, and handle complex build processes.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the 0x1C-makefiles project, you will:

- Understand the purpose and benefits of using Makefiles in software development.
- Learn how to write Makefiles to automate the build process of a project.
- Gain hands-on experience with Makefile syntax, rules, targets, and variables.
- Develop the skills to manage dependencies and handle complex build processes efficiently.

## Requirements

To work on the 0x1C-makefiles project, you need the following:

- A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian) or a virtual machine running Linux.
- A text editor (e.g., Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text) for writing Makefiles and source code.
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the C programs.
